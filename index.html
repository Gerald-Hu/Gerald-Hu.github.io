                I'm a fresh grad from the University of Waterloo.<br>
                <br>
                I made myself a name "Gerald", but if you happen to speak Mandarin, 
                or are down for a challenge, you might also want to call me <b>"Xuān míng"</b>, 
                which is my real name.<br>

                I was born and raised in China before pursuing a degree and a career in Canada,
                which exposed me to both Chinese and Canadian culture, as well as enabled me
                to meet people from everywhere.<br>
                <br>
                Though I've spent years learning and writing math proofs, my passion turns out to end up in coding. 
                Besides that, I enjoy Karaoke, piano, workout, and making cocktails in my leisure time.<br>

                The business attempt was launched by me and some peer students, which was inspired by carpooling. We made bi-direction inter-city (Waterloo - GTA) delivery, focusing on dessert and bubble tea, by cooperating with those who offer frequent carpool services. 
                We developed a Wechat embedded app and a small website to record orders, and managed all delivery details. Though it ceased due to the graduation of team members, our competitor who adopts the same mode is already a registered small business now.(2020) </div>
